# Hey there! 👋 

Thanks for checking out my website. My name is **Moss Pakhapoca** and I'm just a little software engineer based in Austin Texas. I created this website to share and documents my thoughts and my experiences to this corner of the interweb. Besides tech, I like photography and a bit of philosophy, so you may find some of those here as well. All in all, I hope that you will find my contents useful. Cheers! 🍻
